# Whatsapp-Spam-Public Version
This repository contains the script to automatically send a message on Whatsapp Web

### Disclaimer
I made it just for fun and as a bit of challenge to myself. I am not responsible what the Monkey user does with it. Just like People don't take responsibility for the monkeys they elect. I am not even electing, I am just saving my work.
Use it on ur own risk. My suggestion is not to test it randomly. You wanna have fun with it? then have fun with those people who are ok and allow you to do that.
Lastly, Be a human and don't be a monkey/ape once you have it!

### How to use
First, let's make it clear that it only works on Whatsapp Web.
Open the whatsapp web, Access the developer tools on your browser. For Chrome, it's Ctrl+Shift+i
Go to "Console" tab and paste the script in there.
Bang 'Enter" once you have pasted script and edited your message.
